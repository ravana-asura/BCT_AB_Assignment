Create a base class Account with data members accountNumber and balance.
Derive two classes SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount from Account.
Implement polymorphic behavior where the base class pointer can point to objects of
derived classes, and call their respective member functions to deposit and withdraw
money, applying specific rules for each account type.
